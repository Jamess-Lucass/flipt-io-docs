# Authentication

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes.

<Info>
Flipt authentication is **disabled** (not required) by default.

Head to the [Configuration: Authentication](/configuration#authentication) section to enable it.

</Info>

Once enabled, all routes beneath the following API prefixes will require a [client token](#client-tokens) in order to authenticate requests:

- `/api/v1/`
- `/auth/v1/`

### Client Tokens

Client tokens are the core credential required to authenticate a request.
Tokens themselves are acquired via [authentication methods](#authentication-methods).

Flipt will ultimately support multiple authentication methods, however only the [token](#token) authentication method is supported as of now.

Once a client token has been acquired, it can be supplied via request metadata dependent on the protocol ([HTTP](#http) or [gRPC](#grpc)).

#### HTTP

For HTTP the `Authorization: Bearer <client-token>` header is used to present the client token.

**Example:**

```console
GET /api/v1/flags HTTP/1.1
...
Authorization: Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=
...
```

#### gRPC

For gRPC we use the [Metadata](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#metadata) functionality similarly to HTTP Headers.
The lower-case `authorization` metadata key should be supplied with a single string `Bearer <client-token>` to any RPC calls.

**Example (in Go):**

The following example authenticates a single gRPC client request:

```go
ctx := metadata.AppendToOutgoingContext(ctx, "authorization", "Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=")

flag, err := flipt.GetFlags(ctx, &flipt.GetFlagRequest{
  Key: flagKey,
})
```

This subsequent example demonstrates using a client unary interceptor, which authenticates all outgoing requests:

```go
func AuthUnaryClientInterceptor(optFuncs ...CallOption) grpc.UnaryClientInterceptor {
    return func(ctx context.Context, method string, req, reply interface{}, cc *grpc.ClientConn, invoker grpc.UnaryInvoker, opts ...grpc.CallOption) error {
        ctx = metadata.AppendToOutgoingContext(ctx, "authorization", "Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=")
        return invoker(ctx, method, req, reply, cc, opts...)
	}
}
```

### Authentication Methods

<Note>
  See [Configuration: Authentication
  Methods](/configuration#authentication-methods) for details on how to
  configure the various authentication methods.
</Note>

#### Token

<Tip>
  When `token` method is enabled and no tokens exist in the backing store, an
  initial token is created and logged in Flipt's server output.
</Tip>

The `token` authentication method supports statically creating authentication tokens.

Once enabled, the `/auth/v1/method/token` API prefix is mounted to Flipt's API.
This section of the API supports the creation of static tokens.

##### Example: Token Creation

The following `curl` command creates a static token with no expiration.
Given authentication is set to `required` then a prior client token will be required to perform this action.

```console
curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/v1/method/token \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"name":"access_all_areas","description":"keys to the castle"}'
```
