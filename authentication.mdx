description: This document describes how to enable and use authentication with Flipt.
---

Flipt supports the ability to secure its core API routes.

<Info>
Flipt authentication is **disabled** (not required) by default.

Head to the [Configuration: Authentication](/configuration#authentication) section to enable it.

</Info>

Once enabled, all routes beneath the following API prefixes will require a [client token](#client-tokens) in order to authenticate requests:

- `/api/v1/`
- `/auth/v1/`
- `/meta`

### Client Tokens

Client tokens are the core credential required to authenticate a request.
Tokens themselves are acquired via [authentication methods](#authentication-methods).

Flipt currently supports two authentication methods.

1. [Token](#token)
2. [OIDC](#oidc)

Once a client token has been acquired, it can be supplied via request metadata dependent on the protocol ([HTTP](#http) or [gRPC](#grpc)).

#### HTTP

There are two different valid ways to present a client token via a HTTP requests.
The choice allows us to support two different types of workload.

1. Service to Flipt authentication using an `Authorization` header.

For application to Flipt communication over HTTP, the `Authorization` header is most appropriate.
This header must be provided with the client token prefixed with the string `"Bearer "`.

**Example: HTTP Authorization Header Authentication**

```console
GET /api/v1/flags HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=
...
```

2. Browser to Flipt authentication using a `Cookie` header.

<Note>
When using a "session compatible" authentication method (e.g. [OIDC](/configuration#method-oidc)), Flipt will automatically established this cookie via a `Set-Cookie` response header during the authentication flow.

In a browser context this means subsequent API calls will be automatically authenticated given the API requests are invoked with credentials included (cookies are enabled).
</Note>

<Warning>
Please enable [CSRF](/configuration#session) provention in your Flipt configuration when using a "session compatible" authentication method and `Cookie` based authentication.
</Warning>

For browser based applications (e.g. Flipt's own user interface) we support supplying a client token via a particular `Cookie` called `flipt_client_token`. This allows for stateful browser sessions to be established.

**Example: HTTP Cookie Authentication**

```
GET /api/v1/flags HTTP/1.1
Cookie: flipt_client_token=gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=
...
```

#### gRPC

For gRPC we use the [Metadata](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#metadata) functionality similarly to HTTP Headers.
The lower-case `authorization` metadata key should be supplied with a single string `Bearer <client-token>` to any RPC calls.

**Example (in Go):**

The following example authenticates a single gRPC client request:

```go
ctx := metadata.AppendToOutgoingContext(ctx, "authorization", "Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=")

flag, err := flipt.GetFlags(ctx, &flipt.GetFlagRequest{
  Key: flagKey,
})
```

This subsequent example demonstrates using a client unary interceptor, which authenticates all outgoing requests:

```go
func AuthUnaryClientInterceptor(optFuncs ...CallOption) grpc.UnaryClientInterceptor {
    return func(ctx context.Context, method string, req, reply interface{}, cc *grpc.ClientConn, invoker grpc.UnaryInvoker, opts ...grpc.CallOption) error {
        ctx = metadata.AppendToOutgoingContext(ctx, "authorization", "Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=")
        return invoker(ctx, method, req, reply, cc, opts...)
	}
}
```

### Authentication Methods

<Note>
  See [Configuration: Authentication
  Methods](/configuration#authentication-methods) for details on how to
  configure the various authentication methods.
</Note>

#### Token

<Tip>
  When `token` method is enabled and no tokens exist in the backing store, an
  initial token is created and logged in Flipt's server output.
</Tip>

The `token` authentication method supports statically creating authentication tokens.

Once enabled, the `/auth/v1/method/token` API prefix is mounted to Flipt's API.
This section of the API supports the creation of static tokens.

**Example: Token Creation**

The following `curl` command creates a static token with no expiration.
Given authentication is set to `required` then a prior client token will be required to perform this action.

```console
curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/v1/method/token \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer gt6P_zIqTnCngfHDCpWb48ob5EBt3PqunUhpofNCNnc=' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"name":"access_all_areas","description":"keys to the castle"}'
```

#### OIDC

<Note>
Flipts own UI is designed to support this authentication method natively.
Meaning, once enabled, the UI will support login and present each provider as a login button.

The rest of this information is mostly academic.
It is only useful if you want to build your own browser application using cookie authentication.

Head over to [OIDC Configuration](/configuration#OIDC) documentation to learn how to configure your provider(s).
</Note>

The `OIDC` authentication method is primarily designed to support browser based authentication.
However, it can be manually invoked if such a usecase presents itself.

Once enabled, the `/auth/v1/method/oidc` API prefix is mounted to Flipt's API.
This section of the API supports a generic OAuth 2.0 with OIDC flow.

Flipt's configuration can be defined with multiple simultaneous OIDC providers.
An operator of Flipt chooses a name for each provider and then configures the relevant secrets necessary to authenticate with an OIDC client.

There are many OIDC providers out there. For example, we have test Flipt with:

- Google
- Auth0
- Gitlab
- Dex

Each provider has their own way of establishing clients and acquiring the relevant credentials.
You can find futher documentation on leveraging providers like these in our [OIDC Configuration](/configuration#oidc) documentation.

For illustration purposes, let us say we have configured a single provider with `Dex` and named it `dex` (lowercase) in our provider configuration.

This will lead to the following endpoints being available on Flipt:

- `GET /auth/v1/method/oidc/dex/authorize`
- `GET /auth/v1/method/oidc/dex/callback`

These two endpoints are necessary to support the different legs of the OAuth flow.
The first can be requested to obtain an authorize URL directed at the configured instance of Dex.
The latter is the destination that Dex will redirect client back to.
When using HTTP, this callback endpoint will establish the `flipt_client_token` and return it via the `Set-Cookie` response header.
