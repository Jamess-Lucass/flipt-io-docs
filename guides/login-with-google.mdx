In a production environment it is often important to control who has access to your systems and feature flagging is no different.
Flipt ships with built-in mechanisms and configuration for service-to-Flipt and user-to-Flipt authentication.

For service-to-Flipt authentication, Flipt supports static token and Kubernetes-based authentication methods.
However, neither of these methods is appropriate for browser sessions and the UI.
To solve this, Flipt supports [OpenID Connect](/authentication/methods#openid-connect) (OIDC) as a session-compatible authentication method.
OIDC is an open standard supported by many existing platforms such as Google, Okta, Auth0, GitLab, and many more.

In this guide, you will learn how to configure Google as an OIDC provider for Flipt.

By the end of this guide, we will have:

- 🔒 Run Flipt and configured it to `require` authentication
- 🔑 Created an OAuth Client in your Google workspace
- 🔐 Configured Google as an OIDC provider for Flipt

For this guide you're going to need the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com)

## Brief explanation of OIDC

OIDC is an extension on top of the OAuth standard for delegated authentication.
OAuth allows Flipt to delegate authentication to an external provider of your choice.
The OIDC extension provides the **Relying Party** (Flipt in this case) with a well-known protocol for requesting identity from an **Identity Provider** (IdP) (Google in this example).
It ensures that we can support a multitude of IdPs through a standard set of configuration parameters.
This means we do not have to add more code to Flipt each time we want to support an additional identity provider.
As long as the provider conforms to the OIDC standard, Flipt can be configured to leverage it.
It also gives Flipt the option to obtain and present user profile pictures and email addresses in the UI.

## Running Flipt as a docker container

For the purpose of this guide, we will start by configuring and running Flipt with a minimal configuration file.

### 1. Create a new directory

This is an optional step, however, we suggest you create a blank directory in which to experiment with Flipt.

```sh
mkdir ~/flipt-with-google

cd ~/flipt-with-google
```

### 2. Define a Flipt `config.yml`

We're going to create a configuration file named `config.yml` in the current directory.
This file will tell Flipt to increase its logging level to the maximum to aid in debugging.

It will also set authentication as `required = true`.
This is needed to ensure that Flipt enforces its APIs and must be provided with a credential of some sort to gain access.

```yaml config.yml
version: "1.0"

log:
  level: DEBUG

authentication:
  required: true
```

### 3. Run Flipt as a Docker container

Here we run Flipt and mount our local `config.yml` file into the running container.

This will start Flipt as a process in the foreground of your current terminal session.
You can stop Flipt by entering `ctrl+C`.

This particular command forwards your localhost port `8080` into the container's localhost post `8080`.
The `8080` port is the default for Flipt's HTTP service and can be changed via the `server` configuration parameter.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yml:/config.yml" \
  flipt/flipt:latest --config /config.yml
```

### 4. Navigate to the [Flipt UI](http://localhost:8080)

Once you visit Flipt's UI, you should be greeted by a message stating that there are no login providers configured.
As mentioned before, once authentication is required, a session-compatible method is needed to enable login.
We're now going to do that by configuring Google as an OIDC provider for Flipt.

## Creating a Google OAuth client

In order to get Google setup as our IdP, we first need a Google Cloud Account and to create a set of [Google OAuth client ID credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id).
Google's documentation will always be the most up-to-date source for how to achieve this.
However, we will go over some of the details here and strive to keep this guide up to date.

1. Navigate to the [Google Console Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

The API > Credentials section of Google Cloud Console is where you can create new OAuth client credentials.

2. Click `+ Create Credentials`

This presents us with a few options for credential types.

![Google cloud create credentials popover]()

Select the `Oauth client ID` type and you will be taken to an input form (like the one below).

We're first requested to select an `Application type`. We shall choose the `Web application` option.
Once selected you will be presented with more input options.

![Google cloud create oauth client ID form]()

As shown in the screenshot, we'll want to enter the following values for the inputs:

- Application type: `Web application`
- Name: `Flipt` (something to identify the purpose of the credentials)

Under the **Authorized redirect URIs** we're going to select `+ ADD URI`

> Don't get this confused with _Authorized JavaScript origins_

This will present us with an input box which we will populate with the following value:

```url
http://localhost:8080/auth/v1/method/oidc/google/callback
```

This is the redirect URL for your local running instance.
In a production environment, you would replace the domain part of the URI with the public address of your flipt instance.

3. Click `Create`

This should create your credentials if all your inputs validate correctly.
You should be presented with a modal containing your new client credentials.

![Example modal containing Google OAuth client credentials]()

You will need to take note of these values, as you're going to use them in the next step.

## Configuring Flipt with OIDC credentials

Open your `config.yml` from the first steps of this guide.
Now we're going to update your configuration with the details we obtained from Google.

We will:

- Enable the OIDC method
- Configure the session domain
- Define an OIDC provider called `google`
- Add the specific details for the Google OIDC flow and the credentials we've obtained previously

Your configuration should look something like the following:

```yaml config.yaml
version: "1.0"

log:
  level: DEBUG

authentication:
  required: true
  session:
    domain: localhost:8080
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      providers:
        google:
          issuer_url: "https://accounts.google.com"
          client_id: "< client ID from Google >"
          client_secret: "< client secret from Google >"
          redirect_address: "http://localhost:8080"
          scopes:
            - email
            - profile
```

<Note>
If you do not want to add security credentials to your configuration file like this,
then you can also supply these parameters as environment variables. All Flipt configuration
parameters can be supplied as [environment variables](https://www.flipt.io/docs/configuration/overview#environment-variables).

In this example, the client secret can be supplied via the variable `FLIPT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS_OIDC_PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

</Note>

You can now stop and start your Flipt instance using the Docker command we described in Section 1.
Once Flipt has restarted you can to navigate your browser to the [UI](http://localhost:8080) and attempt a login with Google.
When you click `Login with Google` you should be navigated away to your Google consent screen.
Once you grant consent, you should return to Flipt and be logged into Flipt.
